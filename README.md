This repository demonstrates a common, yet dangerous, error in C++: accessing elements outside the bounds of a `std::vector`.  Accessing elements beyond the vector's size leads to undefined behavior.  This can result in crashes, corrupted data, or seemingly random program behavior. The `bug.cpp` file contains code exhibiting this error.  The `bugSolution.cpp` file provides a corrected version using `at()` for bounds checking or ensuring correct size before access.
